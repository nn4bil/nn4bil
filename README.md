Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nabil Arnaoot and I live in San Francisco. After ten years as a Project Manager, most recently at Apple, I'm working on an MS from Saint Mary's College in Business Analytics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics and Python.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on using data to improve the lives of marginalized folks..
ðŸ“« How to reach me: Drop me a line at nnabil over at the mail run by the folks at google.
ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/ him.
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a passionate reader, and occasional writer, of science fiction. I like the stuff that explores radically different ways people can live.
